name = "Russell"
age = 22
school = "Colorado College"
favColor = "Tyrian Purple"
birthday = "October 25th"

print("Hello, My Name is " + name)
print("I am " + str(age) + " Years old")
print("I go to " + school)

print("Next " + birthday + " I will be " + str(age + 1) + " years old")

#Challenge here is combining the variables and strings
#Also Challenge to print a number in a string

#Note You can concatonate the string and the variable with a '+' or a ','
#Ex: print("Hello my name is " + name) is the same as 
# print("Hello my name is", name) is the same as
# print("Hello my name is %s" % (name))

#To print a number with a string, put the str(the number)

#Problems
# not spelling print correctly
# Not understanding the age + 1 has to all be iside the str decleration
# having inconsistent Variable names
